# User Personas

In user experience (UX) terms, a persona is a fictional character created to represent different types of users, and to give insight into their goals, abilities, and behaviors. A good overview of personas can be found at the [usability.gov website](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html "usability.gov Personas")

Personas are invaluable to a technical writer, because they allow you to write with a particular user in mind, and the documentation can be geared towards that userâ€™s skill set and goals. 

I created these personas to use when re-evaluating documentation for a previous employer. I spent time reviewing support tickets for certain products to understand what customers were having trouble with or trying to do, and then looked at some of the demographic information in our CRM system to get a better idea of where our customers were located and any other self-reported information (age, income, etc.). Then I created these personas based on the information I found and my own intuition from dealing directly with our customers. 

The **User Personas PDF** is a ready-made version you can use as-is, or you can also download the corresponding [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice") source doc to use as a starting point to create your own personas (LibreOffice is a free and open source office suite).

This is the original work on user personas.

This is the standard textbook covering the theory of personas, why and how they work, and how to create them. 
* [The Essential Persona Lifecycle: Your Guide to Building and Using Personas](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1859509 "The Essential Persona Lifecycle"), also by Pruitt and Adlin. This is a workbook for creating personas based on "The Persona Lifecycle" that strips out all the theory and just focuses on persona creation. This is the book I used to help create my personas. 
* [Letting Go of the Words: Writing Web Content that Works](http://redish.net/books/item/5-letting-go-of-the-words-writing-web-content-that-works "Letting Go of the Words") by [Dr. Ginny Redish](http://redish.net/about-ginny "Ginny Redish"). While focused more on website usability, "Letting Go of the Words" has a good section on personas. I was able to attend a conference session given by Dr. Redish several years ago, and that is what started my interest in using personas in my own work.
