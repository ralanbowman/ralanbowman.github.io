<h1>NAME</h1>
<p class="subtext">
  Alan Bowman - Technical Writer and User Advocate 
</p>

<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p class="subtext">
  alanbowman [--technicalwriter] [--useradvocate] [--tester] [--other] <br />
</p>

<h1>SUMMARY</h1>
<p class="subtext">
  I am a technical writer with over six years experience in creating documentation that helps users quickly and accurately find answers and solve problems so that they can create amazing software, web applications, and web sites. I am currently working as a contractor for a managed service provider, and my most recent permanent position was for a small web hosting company that focused on providing cloud-based solutions to small and medium-sized businesses and application developers. I also have 12 years experience as a UNIX/Linux system administrator and support tech, working for a division of a large multi-national and then for a smaller web hosting company. 
</p>
<p class="subtext">
  This technical background, along with my documentation experience and user-centric focus, allows me to bridge the communications gap that often exists between the technical information provided by the company and the user-friendly documentation needed by the customer. This same technical background also allows me to work in a tester/QA role to find issues and suggest improvements in products and services.   
</p>
<p class="subtext">
  I also have experience as a user advocate, working directly with the sales, marketing, and admin teams to solicit and review customer and staff feedback on products and services, and then providing suggestions ranging from website copy updates to business process changes. 
</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p class="subtext">
  --technicalwriter
