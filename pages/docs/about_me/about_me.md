My name is Alan Bowman and I’m an experienced technical writer currently seeking a new job opportunity where I can help users and customers find answers, solve problems, and create amazing things.   

As a technical writer, my job is to understand the user: their reasons for using the product or service, their level of technical ability, and their desired end result, and then provide them with exactly the information they need so they can build products and services that help change the world. I document the tool, not the technology.   

As a technical writer, my job is to also understand the needs of the business: the industry they’re in, the marketing strategy and sales goals, and the overall objectives of the company, and then make sure that the information I provide to the customer reflects the company's image and plan of action.   

My skills as a technical writer include:   

* Documenting RESTful APIs (JSON and XML)
* User guides and release notes 
* READMEs and man pages for command line UNIX/Linux/*BSD applications 
* Documenting platform APIs using Doxygen and Javadoc (limited experience)
* JavaScript function/method documentation (limited experience) 

I also have experience with:   

* Project management - managing my own projects and my deliverables in projects run by others
* Customer advocacy - working across all departments to ensure the best user experience for the customer and for the staff 
* Testing and QA - working with the development team to find any issues in new products and services before release
