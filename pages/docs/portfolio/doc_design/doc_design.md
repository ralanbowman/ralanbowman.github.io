Document design is an important part of technical writing. Using basic design principles, you can make your documentation easier to read, easier to navigate, and easier for your users to understand. 

This is a presentation on Document Design that I gave at the August 2015 meeting of the Atlanta Atlassian User Group, and also made available internally at my previous employer. 

* [Document Design: Basic Principles](http://www.slideshare.net/AlanBowman/document-design-basic-principles-67314539) (Note - link goes to [slideshare.net](http://www.slideshare.net))

The four principles of document design covered in the presentation are: 

1. Grouping and Separation (also called Proximity)
2. Alignment
3. Contrast 
4. Repetition 

The presentation goes into specific examples of each principle and shows it in action. 

The best book I have found about document design is here:

* [The Non-Designer's Design Book](http://www.peachpit.com/store/non-designers-design-book-9780133966367) by [Robin Williams](http://www.peachpit.com/store/non-designers-design-book-9780133966367)
