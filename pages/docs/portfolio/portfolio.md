The following are examples of my work in several different contexts: API documentation, traditional user guides, personas, document design, and style guides/word lists.  

The UsesThis API and ViewDNS API show how I would document a RESTful API, one using only JSON for requests and responses, and the other using both JSON and XML. 

The Confluence and Sphinx install guides were written by request for members of a technical writer mailing list who were evaluating both products but were having difficulty with the technical level of the existing documentation. 

The set of Personas was created when I was re-evaluating all our documentation at a previous employer in order to make it more fit for the people who were actually using it. 

The **Document Design: Basic Principles** presentation was given at the August 2015 meeting of the Atlanta Atlassian User Group. The presentation goes over some of the basics of document design and how to apply those to any type of online writing. 

The Style Guide and Word List were created to ensure that all company communications (documentation, website copy, marketing releases, etc.) were consistent in style and wording. 

The How I work section explains some of the tools and methodologies Iâ€™ve used to manage projects and produce documentation.
